# KPCB HashMap
I created and analysed my own implementation of a hash map using lists, single hashing and closed addresing. <br />
I used pyplot to visualize the run time of my algorythm for setting 1000 key-value pairs and deleting 1000 key value pairs. 
This experiement was carried out for 100 sets of key-value pairs and the results were averaged.
